The 5-year-old boy's hospital course included an external ventricular drain insertion for acute hydrocephalus with cerebral edema. He was diagnosed with tuberculous meningitis and received a standard anti-TB regimen of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethionamide. MRI revealed diffuse enhancing nodular leptomeningeal thickening, especially at the basal cisterns, and histopathological examination later confirmed a diagnosis of DL-GNT. The parents later opted for palliative treatment, and the patient passed away 3 months after diagnosis. Further information on the boy's physical exam, symptoms, and response to treatment can be found in the discharge summary.
