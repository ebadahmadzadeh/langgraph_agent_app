The key findings of the patient include abnormal liver function tests with elevated AST/ALT and ALP levels and a total bilirubin level of 2.5 mg/dL, which were later consistent with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma after a percutaneous liver biopsy. The patient's medical history includes cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/mycosis fungoides, type II diabetes mellitus, atrial flutter, and sick sinus syndrome. The patient and family opted for comfort care measures due to medical comorbidities, and follow-up with the primary care physician and palliative care team was recommended.
