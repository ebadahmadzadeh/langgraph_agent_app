Hospital Course Summary:

Admission Date: [Insert date]
Discharge Date: [Insert date]

Patient: [Patient's Name]
Sex: Male
Age: 57 years

Admission Diagnosis: Oxygen Desaturation

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the ICU one week after a positive COVID-19 result due to oxygen desaturation. Physical therapy was initiated promptly after admission, which helped improve the patient's breathing frequency and oxygen saturation. The patient was guided to achieve a prone position resulting in a significant increase in oxygen saturation from 88% to 96%. The patient continued to receive intensive physical therapy, positioning, and oxygen therapy for the next few days. Although there were challenges in achieving the prone position due to the patient's profoundly reduced respiratory capacity and high risk of symptom exacerbation, the medical team succeeded in implementing a safe and individualized approach.

After three days with this regime, the patient was transferred to the normal ward, where physical therapists continued his rehabilitation, including walking and strength training. However, the patient's severe instability remained a challenge. Nevertheless, after nine days from ICU admission, the patient was successfully discharged from the hospital as a pedestrian.

Discharge Condition:

At the time of discharge, the patient's medical condition had significantly improved, and he was considered stable enough to be discharged from the hospital. The patient's oxygen saturation had returned to normal limits, and his breathing frequency had decreased significantly.

Summary:

This course summary demonstrates that the patient responded positively to a physical therapy treatment regimen, including positioning, deep-breathing exercises, and walking. Although the patient's medical condition was quite severe during the initial ICU admission, his rehabilitation resulted in marked improvement, leading to a successful discharge from the hospital.
