The patient with a multifocal invasive mammary carcinoma with high-risk features underwent a right breast simple mastectomy with axillary lymph node evaluation. Adjuvant PMRT was given, and ovarian suppression was started with goserelin 3.6 mg every 28 days along with letrozole 2.5 mg once daily. However, despite goserelin treatment, the patient started having regular menstrual cycles, and triptorelin 3.75 mg IM once every 28 days was started in place of goserelin due to failure of ovarian ablation. Follow up with the oncologist for further evaluation was recommended, along with discussion of the role of oophorectomy to manage risks and benefits of such treatment. Medications were no longer given upon discharge.
