The 68-year-old female patient was diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism with nodular changes and autoimmune encephalitis after presenting with symptoms of anxiety, fear, small steps while walking, reluctance to leave her home, speaking less, being slow to respond, and urinary incontinence. The patient had no prior history of mental illness and had been diagnosed with GAD prior to admission. Lab testing revealed anti-glutamate receptor (NMDA) ratio in the cerebrospinal fluid leading to the diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis. The patient was treated with immunoglobulin (IVIG) and methylprednisolone, and showed improvement in cognitive and emotional function. The patient should have regular follow-up appointments with her primary care physician and neurologist to monitor her hypothyroidism and autoimmune encephalitis, respectively, and should also monitor her blood glucose levels to manage her type-II diabetes. If the patient experiences a relapse of symptoms, she should seek immediate medical attention.
