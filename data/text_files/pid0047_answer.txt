The patient was admitted with a severe stroke and presented with left facial droop, bilateral pinpoint pupils, and right-sided weakness. Thrombolysis was initiated with an intravenous tissue-plasminogen activator, but the patient's GCS declined to 6/15 approximately 40 minutes after the start of thrombolysis. Imaging confirmed a bilateral thalamic infarct, with small left parietal cortical infarction. The patient participated in multidisciplinary rehabilitation sessions over the next month and was discharged to a care home with a discharge diagnosis of stroke with bilateral thalamic infarcts and small left parietal cortical infarction. The patient's current medications were not listed in the case report, and no further follow-up was necessary as the patient passed away one year after the initial presentation to the hospital from an intercurrent chest infection.
