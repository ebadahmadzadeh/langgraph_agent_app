During the patient's hospital stay, treatment for dysphagia progressed gradually, including intensive oral stimulation, facilitation of swallowing, and protection mechanism training. After being unable to eat or drink orally, the patient progressed to pureéd food and mildly thick liquids under supervision, with cough strength remaining weak. The patient eventually became capable of independent food ingestion before discharge.
