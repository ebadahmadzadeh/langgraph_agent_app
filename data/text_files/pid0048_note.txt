Hospital Course Summary:

Patient has been admitted to the hospital for Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) which was suspected during his inpatient stay after presenting with urinary retention issues and facial weakness and numbness. AIDP was diagnosed via EDX studies and the patient was treated with a five-day course of IVIG. On completion of his IVIG treatment, the patient was transferred to inpatient rehabilitation with significant proximal lower extremity weakness and bilateral upper extremities slight weakness. The patient had also lost significant strength in his bilateral lower extremities where dorsiflexion was graded at 1/5 and plantar flexion was graded at 3/5. Sensation to light touch had also diminished in all dermatomes of bilateral upper extremities. 

Upon evaluation in inpatient rehabilitation, patient required significant help to perform toileting hygiene, showering, upper body dressing, lower body dressing, footwear management, rolling left and right, and all transfers. The patient was unable to ambulate and was dependent on a wheelchair. During his four weeks of inpatient therapy, the patient improved significantly, achieving independence in supine-to-sit, upper and lower body dressing, and rolling right and left in bed. The patient was able to stand with the support of his spouse and primarily relied on bilateral upper extremity support via a walker for stability and offloading his lower extremities. At discharge, the patient was given a power wheelchair for mobility as he was unable to transfer in and out of a car, thus requiring a wheelchair van for transportation. The patient's blood pressure remained stable throughout his stay with a reading of 121/65 mmHg upon discharge.
