# LangGraph ReAct Agent
This is a generic (domain agnostic) agent that simplifies development (low code) and deployment (repeatable pattern). The core idea is that the mechanics of the agent remain the same across use cases. Development work is done in 2 lines:
- Continious improvements to the mechanics of the agents such as support for MCP, better tool calling, support for more LLMs, etc.
- Specializing the agent for a use case: this requires development of skills (Anthropics style) and tools.

## Important Notes

### Data

### Choice of Dataset
Choice of the huggingface synthetic dataset has an advantage having ground truth information for the summarization task. Whereas, the MTSamples dataset has no ground truth info. Having said that, the ground truth for the synthetic dataset has been generated by GPT3.5. It can be considered as a weak label, specially if the solution being developed consists of smaller models. Otherwise, if the solution is utilizing newer and large models (e.g., GPT 4+), the ground truth may not be very useful.
